# EriCraft2

Modpacks are currently not allowed to contain EriCraft2 at the moment. EriCraft2 is still under heavy development
and will be for a while since Minecraft 1.8 changed alot with rendering of blocks and items.

EriCraft2 is KitCraft from the start and was only used by developer and friends. Now, I've decided to release it to
the public with the name EriCraft2 instead of KitCraft2.

If you would like to help out with coding or want to team up, tweet to me and I'll get in touch with you as soon as I
can.
